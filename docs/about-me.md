# About me

I am ardent self taught developer and extremely passionate about open source softwares.

My journey into programming started with the amazing book "[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)". This book opened new doors for me, inspiring me to explore various technologies and even become certified in responsive web design. I am also proficient in using the command-line interface (CLI) for Git workflows, making REST API calls using cURL commands, and scripting, among other skills. All along this self-learning journey, I developed a deep empathy for the developer experience and a strong desire to solve developer challenges.
