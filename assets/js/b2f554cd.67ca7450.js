This got me thinking as to why I keep tasking myself with such goals? It\'s not like I have tons of time in my life, so, why do I keep picking up these new learning journeys? Well, the answer is this pattern I noticed in myself. I find immense happiness achieving these unconsciously given goals.\\n\\nSo for my this journey, I am diligently following the \\"API Docs Course\\" from [I\'d Rather Be Writing blog](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/). I spent about an hour early this week to get my perquisites installed and tested. Now, I am all ready to dive into learning API documentation.\\n\\nI will keep posting my journey and learning updates, at least weekly. So, if you are interested, follow me on uncovering \\"What API documentation is anyway?\\".

I would like to share some of the key traits that have helped me become a passionate developer commuity advocate.\\n\\n### 1. Empathy\\n\\nWhen starting a new job, one of the first things I do is to experience the \u2018First Hello World.\u2019 As a self-taught developer, achieving my first \u2018Hello World\u2019 is always an exciting milestone. During this journey, I encountered various challenges that I initially thought were unique to me. However, I quickly realized that these challenges were shared by my community.\\n\\nTo gain insights, I conducted surveys and engaged with our technical consultants and sales engineers. This allowed me to understand the community\u2019s journey better. I gathered data and information, which revealed commonalities between my experiences and those of the community. My ability to truly listen and empathize, having gone through the journey myself, helped me better understand and address the community\u2019s challenges.\\n\\n_**Tip: Always put yourself in their shoes to understand how it feels!**_\\n\\n### 2. Asking Questions\\n\\nAsking questions is a powerful way to gain understanding. I consistently ask a variety of questions to collect valuable feedback. Here are some questions and considerations that have helped me uncover the pain points of the community:\\n\\n- Understanding the community\u2019s journey.\\n- Evaluating the current on boarding experience.\\n- Identifying the steps involved in implementing the product.\\n- Assessing resource requirements.\\n- Gauging the usefulness of available resources.\\n- Exploring the value of other resources.\\n\\nI particularly appreciate open-ended questions, as they provide an opportunity to discover pain points that I may not have personally encountered but are prevalent within the community.\\n\\n_**Tip : Always wear the shoes to understand how it feels!**_\\n\\n### 3. Delivering and Gathering Feedback\\n\\nThe final crucial step is to align deliverables with the leadership\u2019s and company\u2019s overarching goals. It is essential to ensure that what you decide to deliver effectively addresses the community\u2019s challenges. Establish a clear roadmap for achieving your goals. While planning and executing initiatives, maintain consistent communication with your community to ensure that your deliverables are valuable.\\n\\nTrack relevant metrics to gauge the success of your initiatives. For instance, if improving engagement is the goal, monitor metrics such as event registrations, attendance, forum activity, survey response rates, and more.\\n\\n_**[Tip: Measure what matters!](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-audiobook/dp/B07BMJ4L1S/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=metrics+that+matter&qid=1696878706&sr=8-6)**_\\n\\n![devrel_traits](./devrel.svg)\\n\\nThese traits have been instrumental in helping me deliver successful initiatives for my developer community. I receive positive feedback from the community regarding the usefulness of current initiatives and valuable insights about their future needs, which helps inform my strategic roadmaps.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc4b Until next time!"}]}')}}]);
