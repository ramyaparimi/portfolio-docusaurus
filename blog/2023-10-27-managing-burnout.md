## What is burnout?

According to pyschologytoday, burnout is defined as a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress. In today's world, almost everyone is experiencing burnout, however, a lot of us might not be aware of it. I didn't know anything about burnout until I had a series of breakdowns and meltdowns so frequently that I had to revisit a lot of my life choices. I promised myself that I would put myself as my priority and believe me, I never looked back after that decision.

Until last year, a burnout for me almost always lead to a breakdown or a meltdown. As I researched more into my burnout situation, I realized that certain unattended triggers eventually lead to burnout -> meltdown. My own burnout resrearch has helped me tremendously in understanding myself better and I hope this helps you as well. 

I have three ma 

Clutter
Sensory stimulation
Too much social interactions (both personal and professional)

So when ever I notice the above things getting out of hand, I take it slow and take a break. Sometimes even taking a half a day off on a Friday helps me alot to regulate my burn out.I am also able to figure out when I am sensorily overstimlated and take necessary measures before it gets too late.I am also learning to say no.All these things have helped me manage my burn out off late.
