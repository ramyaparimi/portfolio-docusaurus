In the last week, I got myself a new learning journey and as you may have already guessed, its to learn API documentation.

I am an avid learner and yet again I am diving into another unknown landscape. This got me thinking as to why I keep tasking myself with such goals? It's not like I have tons of time in my life, so, why do I keep picking up these new learning journeys? Well, the answer is this pattern I noticed in myself. I find immense happiness achieving these unconsciously given goals.

So for my this journey, I am diligently following the "API Docs Course" from [I'd Rather Be Writing blog](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/). I spent about an hour early this week to get my perquisites installed and tested. Now, I am all ready to dive into learning API documentation.

I will keep posting my journey and learning updates, at least weekly. So, if you are interested, follow me on uncovering "What API documentation is anyway?". I am sure this is going to be a very fun full journey journey.

~ Until later ðŸ‘‹.
